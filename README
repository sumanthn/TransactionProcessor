A simple stream processing framework for processing large set of transactions using Storm (http://storm-project.net/)
Transaction Stream contains a tuple set which is 'Enriched', batched & aggregated to extract summary for a minute.
Subsequently, the batch raw data is persisted into HBase as well as the summary is persisted.
The advantage of using Storm, is the ability to quickly add any functionality by introducing newer 'bolts'.
Storm makes the stream processing so simple by taking away the management of Queues and Worker Threads.
